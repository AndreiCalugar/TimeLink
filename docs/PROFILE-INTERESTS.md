# Profile Interests Management

## Overview

This document outlines the profile interests feature in the TimeLink application, focusing on recent changes and testing strategy.

## Recent Changes

### UI Changes

- **Simplified Interest Display**: The experience level legend (Casual, Enthusiast, Expert) has been removed from the profile view for a cleaner UI while maintaining color coding
- **Interest Colors**: Interest tags are still color-coded based on experience level:
  - Expert: Blue (Primary color)
  - Enthusiast: Green (Secondary color)
  - Casual: Light gray (Surface variant)
- **Fallback Display**: Improved handling of interests without complete data by displaying their ID with prefixes removed

### Technical Improvements

- **Better Error Handling**: The `InterestsSection` component now better handles cases where an interest's data might be missing
- **Navigation Enhancement**: Added automatic navigation back to the profile page after saving interests
- **Integration with ProfileContext**: Ensured proper linking between predefined interests and the main interests array

## Testing Strategy

Tests have been implemented for both the `InterestsScreen` (interests management) and the `InterestsSection` (display component).

### InterestsScreen Tests

The `InterestsScreen.test.tsx` file tests the following functionality:

1. **Initial Rendering**: Verifies that predefined and user interests are correctly displayed
2. **Search Functionality**: Tests the ability to search and filter interests
3. **Interest Selection**: Verifies selecting and deselecting interests works correctly
4. **Custom Interest Addition**: Tests adding a new custom interest
5. **Navigation**: Verifies that the application navigates back to the profile page after saving

### InterestsSection Tests

The `InterestsSection.test.tsx` file (simplified for initial development) will eventually test:

1. **Rendering Without Legend**: Verifies that the legend items (Casual, Enthusiast, Expert) are not displayed
2. **Color Coding**: Ensures that interests are still color-coded based on experience level
3. **Empty State**: Tests the display when no interests are available
4. **Fallback Handling**: Verifies that interests without complete data are displayed correctly

## How to Run Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run only profile-related tests:

```bash
npm test -- __tests__/screens/profile
```

Run a specific test file:

```bash
npm test -- __tests__/screens/profile/InterestsScreen.test.tsx
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add ability to set experience level when selecting interests
- Improve search with filters for interest categories
- Add interest suggestions based on user activities
- Implement interest-based event recommendations
